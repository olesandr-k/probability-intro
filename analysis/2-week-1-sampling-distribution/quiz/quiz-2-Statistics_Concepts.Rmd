# Statistics Concepts Quiz

This quiz will test your understanding of various statistical concepts.

## Question 1: Population & Sample Concepts

```{r question-1, echo=FALSE}
library(learnr)
question_text("Match each term to its definition.",
  answer_text("Population", correct = "The entire group you're studying or generalizing to"),
  answer_text("Sample", correct = "A subset of individuals selected for analysis"),
  answer_text("Parameter", correct = "A fixed numerical value that describes the full population"),
  answer_text("Statistic", correct = "A numerical summary calculated from a subset of data"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)

```

## Question 2: Distributions

```{r question-2, echo=FALSE}
question_text("Match each term to its definition.",
  answer_text("Sampling Distribution", correct = "The distribution of a statistic (like the mean) from many repeated samples"),
  answer_text("Empirical Distribution", correct = "A distribution based on observed data or simulation"),
  answer_text("Theoretical Distribution", correct = "A mathematical model describing how a variable behaves ideally"),
  answer_text("Distribution", correct = "A general term for how values are spread in a dataset"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)

```

## Question 3: Measures of Center & Spread

```{r question-3, echo=FALSE}
question_text("Match each term to its definition.",
  answer_text("Mean", correct = "The average of a set of values"),
  answer_text("Standard Deviation", correct = "A measure of how spread out values are around the mean"),
  answer_text("Variance", correct = "The square of the standard deviation"),
  answer_text("Standard Error", correct = "The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

## Question 4: Central Limit Theorem Concepts

```{r question-4, echo=FALSE}
question_text("Match each term to its definition.",
  answer_text("Central Limit Theorem", correct = "Describes how the distribution of sample means becomes normal as sample size increases"),
  answer_text("Skewed Distribution", correct = "A distribution that is not symmetric (e.g., has a long tail on one side)"),
  answer_text("Normal Distribution", correct = "A distribution that is bell-shaped and symmetric"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)

```

## Question 5: Simulation Concepts

```{r question-5, echo=FALSE}
question_text("Match each term to its definition.",
  answer_text("Sample Size", correct = "The number of individual observations in a single sample"),
  answer_text("Number of Samples", correct = "The total number of samples generated for a simulation"),
  answer_text("Repetition / Replication", correct = "Repeating the sampling process multiple times"),
  answer_text("With Replacement", correct = "Sampling method where items can appear more than once"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)

```

## Question 6: Estimation Concepts

```{r question-6, echo=FALSE}
question_text("Match each term to its definition.",
  answer_text("Sampling Variability", correct = "The natural variation in a statistic across repeated samples"),
  answer_text("Law of Large Numbers", correct = "The tendency for larger samples to better estimate the population"),
  answer_text("Bias", correct = "A consistent error in estimating a population value"),
  answer_text("Precision", correct = "The closeness of repeated estimates to one another"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)

```
