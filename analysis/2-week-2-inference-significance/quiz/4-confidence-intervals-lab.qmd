## Instructions
  
This mini-lesson walks through how to calculate and interpret a confidence interval for a sample proportion. You'll use a real-world example involving public trust in the media. There are interactive questions at the end.

 

## Step 1: The Scenario

> In a random sample of 1,017 Americans, 60% said that **60%** do **not trust** the mass media to report the news **fully, accurately, and fairly**. The standard error associated with this estimate is **0.015** (1.5%). What is the margin of error at 95% confidence level? Calculate a 95% confidence interval and interpret it in context. You may assume that the point estimate is normally distributed 


We want to:
1. Compute the **margin of error** at the 95% confidence level
2. Calculate the **95% confidence interval**
3. **Interpret** results

$$
CI = 
$$ 
Let's expand the second component
$$
CI = 
$$ 
Just to remind what SE is: 

$$
SE = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}
$$

## Step 2: Identify the Ingredients



## Step 3: Compute Margin of Error

The **margin of error (ME)** is calculated as:
$$
ME = 
$$
Where:



In our case:



So we compute:

So:  
$$
ME = 
$$


```r

```



## Step 4: Compute Confidence Interval

A **confidence interval (CI)** gives a range of plausible values for the population proportion. The formula is:

$$
CI = 
$$

Where:



In our case:



So we compute:

$$
CI = 0.60 \pm 0.0294 = (0.5706,\ 0.6294)
$$

‚ü∂ The 95% confidence interval is **(57.1%, 62.9%)**

```r
lower <- p_hat - ME
upper <- p_hat + ME
c(lower, upper)  
```

 

## Step 5: Interpretation
